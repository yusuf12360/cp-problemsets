# CP Problemsets

This is my personal archive of various algorithmic problems that I have authored for national-level competitive programming contests or for informatics training purposes.

To ensure contest integrity, the actual development and testing of these problems were conducted in a private GitHub repository. This public collection contains only non-confidential materials intended for educational reference.

## Contents

For each problem listed, I have included:
* **Problem Statements**: The English-translated version of the description, I/O format, etc.
* **Solutions**: My personal C++ implementation of the intended solution.
* **Editorials**: Detailed explanations of the logic and complexity required to solve the task.
